A leopard can¡®t change its spots means someone won¡®t change. They always be the same
person they¡®ve always been and they l always have the same bad habits.

Examples:

1 told Karen she had to study more if she wants to pass her exams but a leopard can¡®t
change its spots ¡ª she won¡®t do it.

Freddie promised he wouldn¡®t get nto trouble at school but I don¡®t believe him ¡ª a leopard
can¡®t change its spots.

How do YOU say it?
